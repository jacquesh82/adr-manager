Perfect 👍 Here’s an **English version** of the GitHub project description for **ADR Manager**:

---

# ADR Manager

**ADR Manager** is a project designed to standardize, centralize, and automate the management of **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** in a DevOps, SRE, and architecture governance context.

The goal is to provide:

* 📑 A **complete ADR template** in Markdown with YAML front-matter.
* 📂 A **standardized repository structure** for storage and indexing.
* ✅ **Quality checklists** for drafting, reviewing, and maintaining ADRs.
* 🔄 A **clean Git/CI workflow**: dedicated PR, labels, status transitions Proposed → Accepted → Superseded.
* 🛠️ **CI/CD linting tools** (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) to validate front-matter and check links.
* 🧩 A **JSON/YAML schema** to enforce metadata compliance.
* 📊 **Practical examples**: tool adoption (Vault, Backstage, etc.), embedded Mermaid diagrams.

## Why ADR Manager?

In a multi-team, multi-project environment, it is critical to:

* Trace architecture decisions in a transparent way.
* Improve **security**, **reliability**, and **compliance**.
* Reduce decision debt and foster communication.
* Provide a single, durable, and interoperable reference.
